<p>**Artificial intelligence** (**AI**), in its broadest sense, is
[intelligence](/wiki/Intelligence "Intelligence") exhibited by
[machines](/wiki/Machine "Machine"), particularly [computer
systems](/wiki/Computer "Computer").<br><br>
It is a [field of
research](/wiki/Field_of_research "Field of research") in [computer
science](/wiki/Computer_science "Computer science") that develops and studies
methods and [software](/wiki/Software "Software") that enable machines to
[perceive their environment](/wiki/Machine_perception "Machine perception")
and use [learning](/wiki/Machine_learning "Machine learning") and intelligence
to take actions that maximize their chances of achieving defined goals.
[1]<br><br>
Such machines may be called AIs.
Some high-profile [applications of AI](/wiki/Applications_of_AI "Applications
of AI") include advanced [web search engines](/wiki/Web_search_engine "Web
search engine") (e.g., [Google Search](/wiki/Google_Search "Google Search"));
[recommendation systems](/wiki/Recommender_system "Recommender system") (used
by [YouTube](/wiki/YouTube "YouTube"), [Amazon](/wiki/Amazon_\(company\)
"Amazon \(company\)"), and [Netflix](/wiki/Netflix "Netflix")); interacting
[via human speech](/wiki/Natural-language_understanding "Natural-language
understanding") (e.g., [Google Assistant](/wiki/Google_Assistant "Google
Assistant"), [Siri](/wiki/Siri "Siri"), and [Alexa](/wiki/Amazon_Alexa "Amazon
Alexa")); [autonomous vehicles](/wiki/Autonomous_vehicles "Autonomous
vehicles") (e.g., [Waymo](/wiki/Waymo "Waymo"));
[generative](/wiki/Generative_artificial_intelligence "Generative artificial
intelligence") and [creative](/wiki/Computational_creativity "Computational
creativity") tools (e.g., [ChatGPT](/wiki/ChatGPT "ChatGPT"), [Apple
Intelligence](/wiki/Apple_Intelligence "Apple Intelligence"), and [AI
art](/wiki/AI_art "AI art")); and [superhuman](/wiki/Superintelligence
"Superintelligence") play and analysis in [strategy games](/wiki/Strategy_game
"Strategy game") (e.g., [chess](/wiki/Chess "Chess") and
[Go](/wiki/Go_\(game\) "Go \(game\)")).<br><br>
[2] However, many AI applications are
not perceived as AI: "A lot of cutting edge AI has filtered into general
applications, often without being called AI because once something becomes
useful enough and common enough it's [not labeled AI anymore](/wiki/AI_effect
"AI effect").
"[3][4]<br><br>

[Alan Turing](/wiki/Alan_Turing "Alan Turing") was the first person to conduct
substantial research in the field that he called machine intelligence.<br><br>
[5]
Artificial intelligence was founded as an academic discipline in 1956,[6] by
those now considered the founding fathers of AI: [John
McCarthy](/wiki/John_McCarthy_\(computer_scientist\) "John McCarthy \(computer
scientist\)"), [Marvin Minksy](/wiki/Marvin_Minsky "Marvin Minsky"),
[Nathaniel Rochester](/wiki/Nathaniel_Rochester_\(computer_scientist\)
"Nathaniel Rochester \(computer scientist\)"), and [Claude
Shannon](/wiki/Claude_Shannon "Claude Shannon").
[7][8] The field went through
multiple cycles of optimism,[9][10] followed by periods of disappointment and
loss of funding, known as [AI winter](/wiki/AI_winter "AI winter").
[11][12]<br><br>
Funding and interest vastly increased after 2012 when [deep
learning](/wiki/Deep_learning "Deep learning") surpassed all previous AI
techniques,[13] and after 2017 with the [transformer
architecture](/wiki/Transformer_\(machine_learning_model\) "Transformer
  \(machine learning model\)").<br></br>
This led to the [AI boom](/wiki/AI_boom "AI
boom") of the early 2020s, with companies, universities, and laboratories
overwhelmingly based in the United States pioneering significant [advances in
artificial intelligence](/wiki/Advances_in_artificial_intelligence "Advances
in artificial intelligence").
